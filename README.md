Implementation and experiments with "Algorithm 1: 'Pareto Efficient Learning to Combine'" from "Classification with Pairwise Information" draft

Algorithm implementation code in `main.py` and extra functionality in `extra.ipynb`. Experiments on datasets from "Classification from Pairwise Similarity and Unlabeled Data" with a complete pairwise comparison matrix (W) in `full_data_experiments` directory. Experiments with an incomplete matrix (m < n) in `limited_data_experiments` directory (in progress).
